## Interpretation
### ðŸ“‰ Interpretation of the Burn Down Chart (Sprint 3)

1. **Lower Total Story Points Compared to Sprint 2:**  
   The total story points in Sprint 3 are fewer than in Sprint 2, primarily because the number of user stories was reduced from three to two. Additionally, Sprint 3 focused on more clearly scoped featuresâ€”Park Explorer and Walking Itinerary Mapâ€”whose functionalities were relatively simpler. For instance, compared to Sprint 2â€™s authentication and search features, Sprint 3 mostly involved data visualisation and frontend UI, which the team was more confident estimating. This increased estimation confidence led to a more concise SP allocation.

2. **Late Burn Down of User Stories:**  
   As seen in the chart, the actual remaining effort remained static until Day 10. This was largely due to end-of-semester conflicts, which limited team membersâ€™ availability during the first week.  Notably, during the second stand-up meeting held on **May 16**, the Scrum Master acknowledged the delay and proactively **re-emphasised task priorities** and encouraged **better coordination of individual availability**. This helped motivate the team in the final week, leading to a focused push that resulted in most progress being made during late sprint.

3. **Sharp Drop Pattern (Cliff-like Burndown):**  
   The burndown chart exhibits steep declines on Day 10 and Day 14. This cliff-like pattern results from the chart tracking story-level rather than task-level progress. Given the small team size and only two user stories in this sprint, story points were only burned when full stories were completed. In reality, each task (e.g., map dataset, custom marker logic, YouTube embedding, foliage heatmap) was gradually progressed through sub-tasks across multiple days. 

4. **No Reduction in Story Points when certain requirements deprioritised:**  
   On **May 23**, the Product Owner decided to deprioritise the average rating logic for both maps (US07 and US08), due to backend/server-side limitations. However, since this scope adjustment occurred late in the sprint, the **overall story point estimation remained unchanged**, and only frontend components for rating input were delivered. The change did not impact the teamâ€™s sprint commitment, as the frontend logic was already under implementation at that stage.

5. **Final-Day Completion:**  
   On Day 14, the remaining effort dropped to zero, indicating that both user stories were completed and reviewed by the end of the sprint. Despite early delays, the team successfully delivered the Park Explorer and Walking Itinerary Map features, including embedded media, interactive markers, and data overlays as scoped.
