# Project Risk Monitoring - Assignment 2

- Document your Risk Monitoring in Sprint 3 for Assignment 2.
- Project Risk Monitoring is a continuous activity and done throughout the project execution cycle (Sprints)  
- Refer to Risk_Monitoring_Guide_and_Example_and_Guide.md under the Guides folder for guidance on how to document this section. An example is shown.
- You can reuse formatting and sections from the guidance for documenting this section


# üìã Sprint 3 Risk Monitoring ‚Äì Urban Tree Explorer


## üõ†Ô∏è Note on Format Change

This Sprint 3 Risk Monitoring file adopts a revised structure based on the updated instructor feedback provided during Week 11:

In response, we replaced the previous user-story-style risk descriptions with a formal **risk register** and **incident log**. This new format aligns with the lecture and tutorial content and improves traceability of each risk throughout Sprint 3.
