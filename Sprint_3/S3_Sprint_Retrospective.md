# üöÄ Sprint Retrospective ‚Äì Urban Tree Explorer (Sprint 3)

## **Overview**
| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Meeting Facilitator** | Yitong (Scrum Master) |
| **Goal of the Meeting** | Reflect on the final sprint and extract lessons for future collaboration. |
| **Attendees** | Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner |

---

## **What Went Well**
- ‚úÖ Successfully completed **all planned front-end features**, including park detail views, itinerary maps, embedded videos, and user-submitted content.
- ‚úÖ Despite late-stage setbacks, the team maintained **high responsiveness** and collaboration, particularly during the rating system issue.
- ‚úÖ The **Scrum ceremonies** were effectively conducted, with clear progress tracking across all meetings.
- ‚úÖ The team was **self-directed**, coordinated through WeChat, and consistently updated GitHub artefacts without external reminders.
- ‚úÖ Yitong ensured **ongoing artefact maintenance**, including sprint backlog and burndown chart documentation.

---

## **What Could Have Been Done Better**
- ‚è≥ **Task Prioritisation**: The **rating system issue**, discovered late, affected three tasks (`US7_T2`, `US7_T3`, `US8_T3`). Early technical feasibility checks might have prevented this.
- ‚è≥ **Backlog Refinement**: The team **initially underestimated plugin constraints**, causing late sprint deprioritisation.
- ‚è≥ **Time Allocation**: Mid-May academic workload led to delayed development, with most progress concentrated in the final week.
- ‚è≥ **Acceptance Criteria Management**: Some user stories needed adjustment mid-sprint, showing that clearer backend feasibility checks during backlog creation were needed.

---

## **What We Will Do Differently**
- üõ† In future projects, conduct **technical feasibility validation** for third-party tools **before sprint planning**.
- üõ† Allocate **more buffer time** in late sprints to accommodate unexpected bugs or academic clashes.
- üõ† Encourage **more granular backlog refinement** to catch potential blockers earlier in the planning phase.

---

## **Actionable Items (for future practice)**
| Action Item | Owner | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Validate technical feasibility of external tools during Sprint Planning | PO & Dev Team | Avoid mid-sprint deprioritisation due to plugin/API limitations |
| Include buffer time in final sprint estimates | Scrum Master | Account for academic or external obligations |
| Refine user stories collaboratively with clearer technical scope | PO & Dev Team | Prevent mid-sprint criteria amendments |

---

‚úÖ **Summary:** Despite the final sprint's compressed timeline and a late-stage deprioritisation of the rating system's backend integration, the team delivered a robust front-end experience. The successful adaptation to blockers and strong communication ensured the project concluded with all essential user stories fulfilled.
