# Sprint Retrospective – Urban Tree Explorer (Sprint 2)

## **Overview**
| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Meeting Facilitator** | Scrum Master |
| **Goal of the Meeting** | Reflect on Sprint 2 outcomes and improve team performance for Sprint 3. |
| **Attendees** | Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner |
| **Time** | 11th May, 8:30-9:00pm |

---

## **What Went Well**  
- ✅ Successfully implemented two interactive map views with filtering and search functionality.  
- ✅ Completed the UniMelb SSO login feature, meeting core security requirements.  
- ✅ Smooth demo session with client; positive feedback and clear approval of design decisions.  
- ✅ Strong communication and support between team members to finish map features on time.

## **What Could Have Been Done Better**  
- ⏳ **Task Estimation**: Some tasks (e.g. category filtering) took longer than anticipated due to dataset complexity.  
- ⏳ **UI Consistency**: Minor inconsistencies in icons and color usage were only noticed during the final review.  
- ⏳ **Backlog Refinement**: Postponed features like Genus-based coloring could have been better planned earlier.  

---

## **What We Will Do Differently**  
- ⏳ Carefully **review requirements** as a team before Sprint start to avoid misunderstandings (e.g., number of pages).  
- ⏳ **Define internal task priorities**, even when all items are marked "essential" by the client.  
- ⏳ **Establish internal design/implementation standards earlier**, such as UI finalisation, to avoid late-stage pressure.  
- ⏳ Allocate buffer time in last sprint days for integration and polish instead of major task completion.
