| Interactive Tree Map | [US 01] As a member of the teaching team, I want to explore potential meetup locations on an interactive map using tree-based environmental data, so that I can evaluate and choose the most shaded, suitable spot for upcoming PhD meetups. | [AC1-1] Given I am on the interactive map page, When I filter or browse tree-dense areas, Then I should see markers clustered or highlighted where tree density is high and conditions are ideal for meetups. | 1. Map displays all tree data as markers or clusters (if zoomed out).<br>2. Locations with high tree density are visually highlighted (e.g., heatmap overlay or marker grouping).<br>3. Filtering by precinct or tree attributes (e.g., canopy width) is functional.<br>4. Tree density logic tested with multiple data scenarios.<br>5. Feature works on both desktop and mobile. | High | 12 SP | This story involves implementing a tree data–driven interactive map where the teaching team can view areas with dense canopy coverage, evaluate environmental factors (e.g., tree age, species, canopy), and mark preferred meetup locations for later use or sharing with students. | WordPress and Plugins.<br>Urban tree dataset must be loaded and parsed (species, canopy, location, age).<br>Interactive map framework (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox) must be integrated.<br>Data visualisation logic (clustering/heatmap or marker overlays) must be functional. | Core for MVP.<br>Clarity and usability of map markers and overlays are key.<br>Favoriting/marking function should be kept lightweight in Phase 1 (can use localStorage or mock save).<br>Teaching team feedback will be valuable during prototype testing. |
| Interactive Tree Map | (Continuation of previous user story) | [AC1-2] Given I click on a marker representing a tree or group of trees, When the pop-up appears, Then I should see environmental data that helps me assess the spot (e.g., shade potential, number of trees, age of trees). | 1. Pop-up displays relevant tree attributes: species, canopy width, age, location.<br>2. Environmental indicators (e.g., % shade coverage) shown using real or calculated data.<br>3. Information is accurate and formatted clearly for non-technical users.<br>4. Tested with multiple markers to confirm reliability.<br>5. No overlap or bugs in pop-up UI. | High | 16 SP | (Continuation of previous Description) | Marker interaction and pop-up detail panels need to be implemented.<br>Session or simple backend support to store “preferred spots.”<br>Pop-up logic must support additional metadata (e.g., shade level, staff notes). | (Continuation of previous Notes) |
| Interactive Tree Map | [US 02] As a PhD student attending an upcoming meetup, I want to view the chosen meetup location and its environmental details on a map, so that I know what kind of space to expect and can decide how to prepare or participate. | [AC2-1] Given I view the highlighted meetup location, When I click on it, Then I should see a summary of the area: shade level, type of trees. | 1. Clickable popup displays concise summary (tree species, canopy, shade score, comments). | Medium | 5 SP | This story covers the student-facing aspect of the platform. Students need to clearly see the location on the same interactive map, differentiated from general tree data. Clicking it shows environmental context (e.g., level of shade, tree type). | (Same as US01's Descriptions) | Although the developed interactive features show little difference between US01 and US02, the overall development and design process should also consider the student perspective—particularly the kind of information they expect to receive when clicking on a tree marker.<br>UI should reserve space for comments/place marks (for Sprint 3). |

| 2-Factor Authentication | [US 03] As a University of Melbourne staff member or student, I want to log in to the Urban Tree Explorer using my UniMelb credentials with Okta-based 2-Factor Authentication, so that I can securely access the platform using a familiar and trusted login method. | [AC3-1] Given I am on the Urban Tree Explorer login page, When I click the "Login with UniMelb" button, Then I should be redirected to the UniMelb Okta login portal. | 1. A "Login with UniMelb" button is clearly visible on the login page.<br>2. Clicking it initiates redirection to the UniMelb SSO endpoint.<br>3. Redirection tested with valid and invalid links.<br>4. Works in all supported browsers.<br>5. Confirmed that login page URL includes UniMelb identity domain. | High | 5 SP | This user story involves integrating the University of Melbourne's Single Sign-On (SSO) system powered by Okta, with 2-Factor Authentication using the Okta Verify mobile app. Staff and students will log in by being redirected to the UniMelb login portal, optionally using browser-stored passwords, and then completing a 2FA step via a push notification or code on their mobile device. | UniMelb SSO and Okta authentication service must be accessible from the application.<br>Internet access and mobile device support for Okta Verify app (out of the student team's control).<br>Frontend routing must support external redirects and return URL handling.<br>App environment must support session/token storage (e.g., localStorage or cookies).<br>Some coordination may be needed with the university’s IT for whitelisting callback URLs. | This feature is primarily infrastructure-focused but essential for production-readiness and aligns with university-wide identity standards.<br>Implementation may be simplified by using OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect libraries (e.g., Auth0, Firebase Auth if configured to proxy UniMelb).<br>If full Okta integration is not technically feasible in this assignment, a mock 2FA simulation (e.g., dummy code entry after login) may be accepted to simulate the workflow.<br>This story is independent of tree map features but should be prioritized early for secure testing access. |
| 2-Factor Authentication | (Continuation of previous user story) | [AC3-2] Given I have previously saved my UniMelb credentials in the browser, When I reach the UniMelb login form, Then my username and password fields should be pre-filled by the browser, and I should be able to proceed directly to 2FA. | 1. Login fields support browser autofill (not disabled).<br>2. Autofill tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari.<br>3. Users can still manually type credentials if desired.<br>4. Okta login page complies with standard form practices for password managers. | Medium | 13 SP | (Continuation of previous Description) | (Continuation of previous Dependencies) | (Continuation of previous Notes) |
| 2-Factor Authentication | (Continuation) | [AC3-3] Given I’ve submitted valid credentials, When the login is processed, Then I should receive a prompt in my Okta Verify app (push notification or manual code). | 1. Okta 2FA is triggered after valid login.<br>2. Users receive mobile push notification or option to enter 6-digit verification code.<br>3. Tested with real UniMelb test accounts (or simulated flow).<br>4. Support confirmed for both push approval and code entry. | High | 8 SP | (Continuation of previous Description) | (Continuation of previous Dependencies) | (Continuation of previous Notes) |
| 2-Factor Authentication | (Continuation) | [AC3-4] Given I approve the push notification or enter a valid code in Okta Verify, When the verification completes, Then I should be redirected back to the Urban Tree Explorer as an authenticated user. | 1. Successful 2FA redirects to platform homepage/dashboard.<br>2. Authenticated session is stored (e.g., JWT token or session cookie).<br>3. Protected routes only accessible after verification.<br>4. Session tested for expiry and refresh behavior. | High | 3 SP | (Continuation of previous Description) | (Continuation of previous Dependencies) | (Continuation of previous Notes) |
| 2-Factor Authentication | (Continuation) | [AC3-5] Given I reject the 2FA request or enter an invalid code, When verification fails, Then I should be shown an error and remain on the UniMelb login portal with a retry option. | 1. Error message shown if 2FA code is invalid, expired, or denied.<br>2. User remains on the Okta login screen.<br>3. Retry or help options visible and functional.<br>4. Failed attempts logged (if audit logging is enabled by Okta). | High | 8 SP | (Continuation of previous Description) | (Continuation of previous Dependencies) | (Continuation of previous Notes) |
| 2-Factor Authentication | (Continuation) | [AC3-6] Given I successfully logged in via UniMelb SSO with 2FA, When I return to the platform within the UniMelb session timeout window, Then I should remain logged in without being prompted to authenticate again. | 1. Session/token remains valid for the configured duration.<br>2. Verified no re-login required during session period (e.g., 1–2 hours).<br>3. Logout clears session properly.<br>4. Tested return visit within timeout and post-timeout. | Medium | 5 SP | (Continuation of previous Description) | (Continuation of previous Dependencies) | (Continuation of previous Notes) |
