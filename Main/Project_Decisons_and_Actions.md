| Date       | Stakeholder                          | Action/Decision                                                                                                                | Impact on Project                                                                        | Follow-up Actions                                                                            |

| 2025-04-09 | Dr. Rajesh Chittor Sundaram (Client) | Current UI is too complex; future versions should be simplified, though existing color blocks can reference the official site. | Requires redesign with cleaner layout, ensuring visual consistency with client branding. | Revise UI with simplified layout and retain visual references from the official website.     |
| 2025-04-09 | Dr. Rajesh Chittor Sundaram (Client) | Approved the idea of reducing dataset size, provided a justification is given.                                                 | Unblocks data import issues for WordPress map integration.                               | Document rationale for dataset reduction and proceed with smaller dataset.                   |
| 2025-04-09 | Dr. Rajesh Chittor Sundaram (Client) | Asked the team to propose interaction methods for map layers, rather than expecting direct user input.                         | Puts design responsibility on the team, encouraging proactive UX planning.               | Prepare main and alternative solutions for map layer interaction before next client meeting. |
| 2025-04-09 | Xin (Product Owner) & Dev Team       | Re-emphasized the importance of documentation and delivering a realistic MVP due to low team motivation.                       | Refocuses team priorities and improves accountability.                                   | Keep documenting progress; simplify feature goals to align with MVP.                         |
| 2025-04-09 | Xin (Product Owner) & Dev Team       | Re-estimated story points based on implementation experience.                                                                  | Makes workload more realistic and achievable within sprint timeline.                     | Update Sprint Backlog with new estimates and adjust timeline accordingly.                    |
| 2025-04-15 | Teaching Team (Clients)              | Login page is not required for Sprint 1. Teams should deactivate any implemented login features.                               | Login functionality removed from current sprint scope.                                   | Deactivate login page implementation; wait for further instructions in future sprints.       |
| 2025-04-15 | Teaching Team (Clients)              | 2FA requirement deprioritized for Sprint 1 due to technical issues in the multi-site environment.                              | 2FA functionality will not be implemented in Sprint 1.                                   | Do not proceed with 2FA plugin setup; document the issue and close as deprioritized.         |
| 2025-04-17 | Dr. Rajesh Chittor Sundaram (Client) | Confirmed that Sprint 1 outcomes (map, markers, heatmap, interaction) were excellent and acceptable. UI is currently fine.                                        | Validates the teamâ€™s implementation direction; no major changes required for Sprint 1 deliverables.     | Proceed with Sprint 2; continue refining based on minor client suggestions.                                   |
| 2025-04-17 | Dr. Rajesh Chittor Sundaram (Client) | Suggested future improvements: larger default map display, more playful tree icons, and possible use of OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps.                    | These are not blockers, but optional UX enhancements for upcoming sprints.                              | Log as optional UI/UX improvement backlog items for Sprint 2 or 3.                                             |
| 2025-04-17 | Dr. Rajesh Chittor Sundaram (Client) | Mentioned interest in restoring more dataset records in future versions (not mandatory).                                                                         | No immediate impact on MVP; can enhance data richness later.                                             | Tag as "nice to have"; explore feasibility of increasing dataset size in later sprints.                        |
| 2025-04-17 | Teaching Team       | Clarified that story points for Sprint 1 do not need to be reduced despite 2FA deprioritization, but reallocation must be explained.                             | Maintains Sprint 1 velocity and scope; requires accountability in task redistribution.                   | Add explanation in sprint report on how saved capacity from 2FA was used to support map feature completion.   |
