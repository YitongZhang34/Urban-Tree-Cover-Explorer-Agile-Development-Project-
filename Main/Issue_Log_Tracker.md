### **Updates**

- **2025-05-08 Update**: After investigating DEF-004 and DEF-005 with the teaching team (on behalf of WordPress IT), we discovered our server was crashing due to oversized unused data (failed uploads and large map assets). We have now cleaned the server, and performance has returned to normal.

- **2025-05-09 Update**: After our Sprint Showcase with Rajesh, DEF-006 has been confirmed resolved. The implementation meets the requirement of displaying the 10 nearest trees with no further action needed.

- **2025-05-23 Update**: Following the 5/23 Ed discussion response, all rating-related backend integration tasks (DEF-011) were deprioritised due to plugin/server issues. Only frontend logic was retained, and Acceptance Criteria were amended by the PO.

## Defect Log Best Practices

Maintaining a high-quality defect log relies on consistently following these key practices:

### Immediate Documentation
Report defects as soon as they are discovered to ensure accurate, real-time tracking and avoid missing critical issues.

### Clear Severity Levels
Classify each defect based on its **impact on the system**, using consistent levels include:

- **Critical üî¥**: A defect that causes the system to crash or results in a complete failure of a critical feature, blocking the functionality entirely.
- **High üü†**: A significant defect that affects core functionality but can be worked around temporarily, requiring a quick fix.
- **Medium üü°**: A moderate defect that impacts non-critical functionality and may be deferred without immediate consequences.
- **Low üü¢**: A minor defect that has little to no impact on functionality, typically cosmetic or related to user interface improvements.

### Timely Resolution
Assign each defect to a responsible developer quickly, and monitor progress to ensure that fixes are implemented within reasonable timeframes.

### Testing and Verification
All fixes must be **verified by testers** before the issue is marked as resolved. Proper testing ensures the solution addresses the defect without introducing new bugs. Always document:

- The tester's name  
- The test date  
- Confirmation that the defect is no longer reproducible
