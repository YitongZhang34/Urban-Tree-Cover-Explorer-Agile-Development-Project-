## Sprint Showcase Outcomes for Urban Tree Explorer – Interactive Map

| **Category**           | **Details** |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Sprint Goal**        | Build an interactive tree map for visualising tree data and enable basic login interface. |
| **Completed Features** | - Imported and parsed urban tree datasets  <br> - Plotted tree locations on map using markers or clusters  <br> - Implemented heatmap/density overlay  <br> - Enabled zoom, pan, and responsive behavior on map  <br> - Showcase the basic details of trees in pop-ups  |
| **Postponed Features** | - UniMelb SSO login feature moved to future sprint. <br> - 2FA deprioritized as of 15 April 2025. |
| **Demo Summary**       | - Sprint 1 showcase conducted with Dr. Rajesh on 17 April 2025. <br> - Demonstrated interactive tree map with clustering, heatmap, and tree details. <br> - Showed responsive map behavior and current UI layout. |
| **Stakeholder Feedback** | - Client was pleased with progress and confirmed current UI is acceptable. <br> - Suggested improvements: larger map view by default, more playful tree icons, and possible use of OpenStreetMap for more layers. <br> - Expressed interest in displaying more dataset records in the future (not urgent). |
| **Action Items**       | - Explore adjusting default map display size. <br> - Research use of OpenStreetMap as alternative to Google Maps. <br> - Consider playful tree icons for better visual engagement. <br> - Document how saved story points from 2FA were reallocated to map functionality. |

##About the dataset:
DBH > 30 cm, canopy ≥ 50%, life expectancy > 1 year, straight-line distance < 5 km
* Walking: Maximum comfortable straight-line distance is approximately 3 km
* Tram: Maximum comfortable straight-line distance is approximately 10 km
* Driving: Maximum comfortable straight-line distance is approximately 30 km

Around Melbourne, a 5 km straight-line distance roughly corresponds to:
* Latitude difference (north-south): ~0.045 degrees
* Longitude difference (east-west): ~0.055 degrees

Melbourne Connect
* Latitude: -37.8000574 ± 0.045 → from -37.8450574 to -37.7550574
* Longitude: 144.9644448 ± 0.055 → from 144.9094448 to 145.019444
