## üöÄ Sprint Retrospective Outcomes for Urban Tree Explorer ‚Äì Sprint 1

### Sprint Retrospective ‚Äì Urban Tree Explorer (Sprint 1)

## **Overview**
| Category               | Details                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Meeting Facilitator** | Scrum Master                                              |
| **Goal of the Meeting** | Reflect on Sprint 1 process and outcomes to improve collaboration and sprint execution. |
| **Attendees**          | Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner                                          |

## ‚úÖ What Went Well
- **Team collaboration & dynamics**: The team worked very well together, and all scheduled meetings were attended on time with a positive and productive atmosphere.
- **Effectiveness of Scrum ceremonies**: Every team member came prepared to Scrum events and actively shared their deliverables during discussions.
- **Task management & estimation accuracy**: The Product Owner took time early in the project to understand each team member‚Äôs background, resulting in effective task distribution.
- **Backlog refinement practices**: The Product Owner handled changes and unexpected challenges (e.g., illness of a dev member) with effective coordination and workload adjustment.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Have Been Done Better
- **Task management & estimation accuracy**: Tasks were initially planned on a daily basis, which created pressure and a lack of flexibility. Future sprints should allow more flexible time blocks so members can manage their own pace.
- **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria clarity**: We initially overestimated our development capacity, planning high-fidelity UI designs (e.g., matching the UniMelb website). Later, the team realized the designs were beyond current skills, leading to discarded designs and some rework.

---

## üîÅ What We Will Do Differently
- During backlog planning, we will set more realistic goals to avoid unnecessary work and reduce future rework.
- We will allow more flexible scheduling within the sprint to give members autonomy in managing their workload pace.
